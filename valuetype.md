Boolean	            |   bool	            |   true/false
Integer	            |   int/uint	        |   Signed and unsigned integers of varying sizes.
Integer	            |   int8 to int256	    |   Signed int from 8 bits to 256 bits. int256 is same as int.
Integer	            |   uint8 to uint256    |	Unsigned int from 8 bits to 256 bits. uint256 is same as uint.
Fixed Point Numbers |	fixed/unfixed	    |   Signed and unsigned fixed point numbers of varying sizes.
Fixed Point Numbers |	fixed/unfixed	    |   Signed and unsigned fixed point numbers of varying sizes.
Fixed Point Numbers |	fixedMxN	        |   Signed fixed point number where M represents number of bits taken by type and N represents the decimal points. M should be divisible by 8 and goes from 8 to 256. N can be from 0 to 80. fixed is same as fixed128x18.
Fixed Point Numbers |	ufixedMxN           |	Unsigned fixed point number where M represents number of bits taken by type and N represents the decimal points. M should be divisible by 8 and goes from 8 to 256. N can be from 0 to 80. ufixed is same as ufixed128x18.
